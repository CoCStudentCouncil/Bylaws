# Section 1. Powers and Duties of the Executive Board:
The Executive Board shall ensure that Student Council is an effective organization, abiding by its constitution. All
Executive Board members are required to attend the Town Halls, barring emergencies, in which case the absent member
shall appoint another member of Student Council temporarily. If the absent member is unreachable, remaining board
members shall assign a temporary replacement. Such replacement should be made at least 6 hours before the meeting.

The responsibilities of the chairs are as follows:

* Scheduling meetings, including establishing meeting times convenient for majority of the members (specifically, a good
  faith effort should be made to schedule meetings such that quorum can attend) and booking a room of appropriate size
  (which shall be considered to be a room whose occupancy limit is no less than 75 persons) on the Georgia Tech main
  campus in Atlanta.
* Ensuring the constitution is followed.
* Moderating the discussions according to the manner described in the constitution.
* Compiling the meeting resolution, and publishing it publicly no later than 24 hours after the meeting.
* Meeting with the Dean of the CoC between 3 days and 2 weeks following the Town Hall to discuss the resolution.
* Facilitating elections.

The responsibilities of the Secretary are as follows:

* Preparing a tentative meeting agenda for the upcoming meeting and distributing as described below.
* Advertising meetings. At a minimum, this entails sending an email containing the meeting agenda to cc-newsandevents
  between one and two weeks prior to the meeting with the correct meeting time and location. A follow up email with any
  changes to the meeting time or location after this initial email should be sent to cc-newsandevents with the updated
  information within either 24 hours of the change or 6 hours before the meeting, whichever is soonest.
* Recording meeting minutes, and publishing them after the meeting.
* Managing the documentation for Student Council, by keeping its online presence up to date. This includes posting
  recent activity, updating the constitution or bylaws whenever there is a change, and maintaining the history of the
  Council.

# Section 2. Powers and Duties of the Student Advisory Board:
Student Advisory Board shall represent the voice of the CoC students. All members of the Student Advisory Board are
required to attend the Town Hall meetings of Student Council, barring emergencies, in which case the absent member shall
appoint another member of Student Council temporarily. If the absent member is unreachable, remaining board members
shall assign a temporary replacement. Such replacement should be made at least 6 hours before the meeting.

The responsibilities of the Student Advisory Board are as follows:

* Be present and advise the Student Council during the Town Hall meeting,
* Be available to the CoC administration and the faculty when their advice is requested,
* Bring the concerns and viewpoints of their respective groups to Student Council to better inform the discussion.

# Section 3. Discipline of Members:
Chairs reserve the right to decide whether a member is acting in a disruptive way. If both of the chairs agree that the
member is acting disruptively, the member is given a suspension effective immediately. A suspended member should leave the meeting immediately if there is one in progress. The suspension time depends on the number of previous suspensions
the member received within the current semester. If the violation is the memberâ€™s first within the current semester, the
suspension time is 1 week. Each additional disruptive behavior as decided upon by the chairs will require twice the
previous suspension period. The suspension decision can be appealed by members other than the suspended member with a
motion, which also specifies the voting mechanism, during the Town Hall. If the motion is seconded by at least a majority vote and a quorum is present, the suspension decision is reversed. There can be at most one motion to appeal for
the same member per meeting.

# Section 4. Amendments:
Bylaws can be amended in any Town Hall by majority when a quorum is present. When voting for a new bylaw, or to remove
an existing bylaw, quorum should be present and the amendment should receive a majority of the present votes to pass.
The amended bylaws should be made available to all the members and the CoC administration within 48 hours.

# Section 5. Maintenance of the Constitution, Bylaws, and Resolutions:
The Constitution and its unabridged revision history will be maintained in a publicly viewable GitHub repository. The
executive board will have write access to this repository, and its maintenance will be the responsibility of the
Secretary. Constitutional amendments will be submitted as pull requests to this repository, and will be merged into the
repository upon ratification.

The Bylaws and their unabridged revision history will be maintained in a publicly viewable GitHub repository. The
executive board will have write access to this repository, and its maintenance will be the responsibility of the
Secretary. Proposed bylaws will be submitted as pull requests to this repository, and will be merged into the repository
if accepted.

All Town Hall meeting resolutions and their unabridged revision history will be maintained in a publicly viewable GitHub
repository. The executive board will have access to this repository, and its maintenance will be the responsibility of
the Secretary.
